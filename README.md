# idendrogram

idendrogram helps you create nicer, interactive visualizations of hierarchical clustering trees (a.k.a. dendrograms) from clustering outputs generated by your preferred hierarchical clustering library (SciPy, Scikit-learn or HDBSCAN) in your preferred python visualization library (Altair, Plotly or Matplotlib)

It also supports bi-directional Streamlit integration via a custom D3-powered component.
